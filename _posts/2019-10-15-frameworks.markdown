Django looks very promising, and its "batteries included" philosophy would help with the various tools we'll need to implement. Being python, the code itself is also easier to read than most other options.

Ruby on Rails seems like a good option. It seems like the most likely complications would include ones where we want to do something slightly different than what they have implemented, which would require digging into ruby code when for the majority of tasks that would be unnecessary.

Laravel tries to solve a majority of the issues with creating a website, which seems like a good fit for newer website developers. As our project is designed to be used on a school-wide basis for the foreseeable future, Laravel's focus on larger applications fits our needs.

ASP.NET, while intimidating due to it being an unknown language to me, seems like it would be a good option. Being created by Microsoft means its community is much larger than the other options, so there's a great chance any questions or problems we encounter are already solved somewhere on the web.

Express and Flask seemed concerningly minimalist. I get having a simple base framework allows the developers to add what they need, but the potential for the add-ons causing complications in both implementation and during interaction with each other seems like too great a risk. I would rather work with a framework that has things like databases already implemented.
