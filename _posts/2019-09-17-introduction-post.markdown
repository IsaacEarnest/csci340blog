Overall, setting up the blog was a very smooth experience. The instructions on the lab page were very clear, and the only time I encountered any problems was when I glossed over when I was supposed to change directories. I would say using the command prompt was the most interesting part of the lab, watching it do so much background work with only a few inputs was impressive.

This wasn't the first time I've seen the sudo command, as over the summer I tried implementing an [osu! bot][osu-bot] for one of my Discord servers. It quickly became a task that seemed way out of reach, using many programs/languages I'd never seen before. Taken from the page, I tried working with
+ [Node.js 10 LTS][nodejs]
+ [node-gyp][nodegyp]
+ gcc/g++
+ [node-canvas dependencies][nodecanvas]

and eventually gave up due to confusion. I don't see these directly on the course description, but I hope this class will help me learn to use these programs for not only the Discord bot, but also for other similar programs in the future.

When I first finished step 4, I was worried I did something wrong as the blog looked like a website without any css. While I'm not sure quite how the Jekyll code works, it was good to see the blog fixed with a single line. I'm looking forward to customizing the blog, and expanding my knowledge on Jekyll.
