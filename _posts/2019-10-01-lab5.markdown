When designing the framework, one of the assumptions I made was that when the seller was paid for his item, the 5% auction fee would be automatically taken off by the company. Since I already had the final price of the item as an entry, adding an additional entry to the successful auction connection seemed redundant.

When making the draw.io version, the diagram felt fairly complete. But when I opened up Vertabelo and saw their example of a "simple" framework, I realized I could make my diagram a whole lot more complex. It feels like the real issue is finding a balance between what the client wants out of their program, as it seems really easy to add too much.
