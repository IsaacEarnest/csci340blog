It feels like no matter which step I was on, my next goal was like a rotating 4D cube. I could see it in front of me, but it would keep changing and I never quite understood. I made the initial mistake of trying to implement Jasper by dragging over a couple files at a time as the command prompt requested them in the server. What I ended up with was a jumbled mess of files that I had to eventually just scrap and revert a night's worth of work. I learned that if a certain approach isn't working, it's probably worth reverting and trying another method instead of hardheadedly trying the same thing.

I did get fed up enough to capture one of the recurring problems, where I would watch files physically delete themselves, as a [gif][gif]. I think the part I struggled *most* with was finding what file to change that wouldn't be edited by another file when the server was run. Simply doing ctrl+f and replacing all instances of a website link with another seemed to work less than half the time. It still feels like a guessing game when I change a file, I can only hope when I run the server that the html doesn't revert to what it was before.

The whole learning process feels completely different from other subjects. It seems like a constant theme is to throw myself at a task with no real idea how to start, work on it for a few hours and give up in frustration, only to wake up and know exactly what to do. But resources like the [Markdown Cheatsheet][markdown] are immensely helpful, letting me focus on the parts of coding which aren't just syntax memorization.

Anyways, here are a couple of cute pictures I found while looking for replacement images in step two.
