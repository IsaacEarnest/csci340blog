This one was quite the struggle, and for all the wrong reasons. I spent the last few days of my vacation sick, which was right around the time I had allotted for this lab. I then resolved to just let it be late and work on it after I came back. Unfortunately that just meant I was both sick and jetlagged while putting the webpage together, so there were a handful of times I got stuck for chunks of time because things were spelled slightly incorrectly. Most of the Kahn Academy tutorials were things covered in class, but there were a few new functions and interactions from there that I found useful. At this point, using the APIs doesn't seem that difficult, and there's a lot of potential to do exciting things in the future. The delay on the setTimeout function is still broken, but for now I'll call that the dev testing mode. 

Aside from the cs learned in this lab, I also learned how hard it is to stay caught up on schoolwork while traveling. If nothing else, this is a good lesson in time management.
