## About my Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This is my personal blog for the CS340 class at Hendrix College. I'm currently an enrolled full-time sophomore, currently undeclared but firmly set on computer science as my major. I enjoy hikes and playing games with friends, be it board games or video games.
